Considered the greatest bounty hunter in the world, Duane "Dog" Chapman
has made more than 10,000 captures in his 40 + year career. This highly
intense, charismatic ex-con and born-again Christian is the king of the
comebacks. This modern-day hero once served time in a Texas prison. "I
am what rehabilitation stands for," Dog says.
More Dog and his posse have enjoyed filming hundreds of episodes of both Dog The Bounty Hunter on A&E and Dog and Beth On The Hunt on CMT. He is a New York Times Best Selling author of not one, but two captivating books.We are happy you are here. Take a look around and see the many new things we have happening!
