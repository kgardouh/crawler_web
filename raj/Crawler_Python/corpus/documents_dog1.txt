Paws That Refresh
Why We Are TDI Members
By: Annette Smith
Last Tuesday during our weekly visit to the local hospice residence, I discovered why my TDI dog, Nicky Bella, and I are committed to these visits.
In the hallway I stopped to chat with a family member who mentioned that her Mom had been an avid dog lover, and would have loved to have seen Nicky Bella.
Unfortunately, she had just received the Last Rites, was in a coma, and was surrounded by her family members.
Nicky and I went into the room, and after talking about Nicky for a while, I noticed that this woman had slightly opened her eyes.
I pulled a chair up to the bed, and had Nicky get on it.
The comatose patient actually reached up and gave Nicky a little pet before closing her eyes, and sinking back into her deep sleep.
The family members were beside themselves.
They couldn’t believe what they had just witnessed.
I still get choked up when I think about this.
Nicky Bella, a dog that was rescued off the streets at 6 months of age, and then sat in a kennel for 3 years, is now giving so much to so many.
She does a weekly Tail Waggin' Tutors program with a 4th grade and a local library, tags along while I help transport wheel chairs for a weekly church service at our County Nursing home (and of course has to visit with everyone along the way), regularly visits other nursing homes, a drug treatment program and will be adding a soon-to-be-opened assisted living home.
Of course she attends Sunday Services and sits on the altar with the choir.
These Therapy Dogs give so much to so many, and I have no doubt that upon crossing the Rainbow Bridge, they will take their rightful place at the foot of our Lord in Heaven!
SUPER-PAWS
It just has to be said! There are many TDI volunteers who work behind the scenes. They are the kind of volunteers which make our organization so successful. These volunteers not only work with their Therapy Dogs to bring joy to so many people, they are doing something else to further our work. We do have a column, Paws-Up, in our Newsletter, but we want to share this with everyone! They are the unsung heroes! With their work they make it possible for our volunteers to be where they are needed. Therefore, from now on we will continue to list these volunteers on our Social Media Pages under Super-Paws!
Lauren Friedman, TDI Evaluator-----------for re-evaluating each and every registered TDI DOG prior to being permitted to visit in the schools of Newtown. Countless hours are spent on traveling and re-evaluating the potential volunteers.
Karen Haney-----------for the scheduling of all the TDI volunteers who visit on a continuing daily basis in some of the schools in Newtown. Scheduling with the schools and the volunteers, informing volunteers of all the visiting opportunities and cheering them on takes a very special person and is a tremendous amount of work.
TDI has made a commitment to the people of Newtown. We are there for you with our Therapy Dogs as long as we are needed and wanted.
